Dear <%= @user_invite.email %>,

You have been invited to create an account on the Kit platform. To create your account, please follow the link below:

<%= @link %>

You will be prompted for your name and asked to create a password. Once you have set up your account, you can log in using your email (<%= @user_invite.email %>) and password at <%=root_url%>.

If you have any trouble setting up an account or have a question, please contact your professor.

Please do not reply to this email, as it was sent by a lazy robot who never checks its inbox.
